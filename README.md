# 2024 Spring - Problem Solving & Algorithms

Welcome, new detective to CC Investigations, the most appraised detective agency
in Cee City! Poco's seen your potential and wants to hire you as a junior
detective, but every good detective has to start somewhere. He's set up some
training exercises for you and even a case for you to solve afterwards!

## Exercise information

You may find something that looks like this in the files.

```py
def function(n: int) -> list[str]
```

This means that the function takes in a variable ``n`` of type ``int`` and returns a ``list`` with elements of type ``str``. The exact types and variable names will change depending on the question.

Note that you **should not** be touching anything outside of the function implementations
in ``puzzles/part1.py``, ``puzzles/part2.py`` and ``puzzles/part3.py``. Messing around with other
files could prevent you from using provided functions or reset your progress. 

To start, run ``mystery.py`` and navigate to ``puzzles/part1.py`` to fill out the functions!

## File layout

> `README.md` - this file contains information about other files \
> `progress.txt` - file that saves what level the user is up to, SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED EVER \
> `mystery.py` - file that houses the main game \
> `internal/*` - internal files that shouldn't be modified \
> `puzzles/*` - files where students will write the solutions to the puzzles

## To run game

```shell
./mystery.py # runs the game
```

if that doesn't work, type `chmod +x ./mystery.py` first.
