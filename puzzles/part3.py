""" ------------------------------ Question 11 ----------------------------- """
# You are given an integer array "coins" representing coins of different
# denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
#
# Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount.
# If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins,
# return -1.
#
# Example cases:
#   Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
#   Output: 3
#   Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
#
#   Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
#   Output: -1
#
#   Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
#   Output: 0
#
# Assumptions:
#   You have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
